# The following password specification generates all of the following passwords:
# ('hello' or 'bonjour' or 'hola') followed by ('' or 'mister' or 'master')  followed by ('smith' or 'jefferson')
# e.g. hellopresidentjefferson, bonjoursmith, holamistersmith, etc.

# '' is the "empty string". It is invoked in the generation of the password bonjoursmith in the examples above.
# All lines with single entries should have a trailing comma within the parentheses; for example ('brother',)

# Additional Notes:
# The empty string '' comes in handy when you don't remember if you did or didn't include some part of the password
# Use the # symbol to comment out a line in the password specification


# [
#     ('hello', 'bonjour', 'hola'),
#     ('', 'mister', 'president'),
#     #('brother', ),
#     ('smith', 'jefferson')
